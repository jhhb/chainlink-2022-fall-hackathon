## Local development
- See the the recommended instructions provided in the project root here, following them for both the backend and frontend since the frontend has a hard dependency on the contract deployment: https://github.com/jhhb/vrf8ball.link/blob/master/README.md#local-development
    - But, if you want to develop semi-locally, you can actually connect to the Goerli network in your browser and run the frontend locally; it will pick up the live contract.
